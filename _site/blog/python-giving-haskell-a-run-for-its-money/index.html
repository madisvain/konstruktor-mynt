      <h2 class="title">Python giving Haskell a run for its money</h2>
      <p class="post-data">
          Posted by Madis Väin on 11 Jan 2012.
          
            <span class="grey">haskell, </span>
          
            <span class="grey">python</span>
          
      </p>
      <p>Everybody knows Haskell beats Python in speed - always. The main reason being is that Haskell is compiled but Python interpreted. There have been some general posts about this all around. But lets give it a fair trial before finding guilty - lets add PyPy to the mix.</p>

<p>PyPy is a implementation of Python written in Python as the name actually suggests. There are tests to suggest that it actually outperforms CPython by quite a margin. And it does this by using JIT (Just In Time Compiler) and better memory management. So it&#39;s a blazing fast solution but they have not stopped there. They have plans for supporting Python 3 in PyPy and numPy in PyPY.</p>

<p>Previous posts have suggested that Haskell is 60 x faster then Python and others that maybe around 5x faster. This seemed a large cap - but these tests were done 2007. So I&#39;m very eager to challenge them according to todays standards.</p>

<p>Naive Fibonacci Algorithms<br>
So the little scripts will be calculating and outputting fibonacci numbers which are are the numbers in the following integer sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...</p>

<p>By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.</p>

<p>Haskell implementation<br>
~~~ { haskell }<br>
fib :: Int -&gt; Int<br>
fib 0 = 0<br>
fib 1 = 1<br>
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)</p>

<p>main = forM_ [0..35] $ \i -&gt;<br>
    printf &quot;n=%d =&gt; %d\n&quot; i (fib i)<br>
~~~</p>

<p>Python implementation<br>
~~~ { python }<br>
def fib(n):<br>
   if n &lt;= 1:<br>
      return n<br>
   else:<br>
      return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)</p>

<p>if <strong>name</strong> == &quot;<strong>main</strong>&quot;:<br>
    for i in xrange(36):<br>
        print &quot;n=%d =&gt; %d&quot; % (i, fib(i))<br>
~~~</p>

<p>Results<br>
Haskell (optimized) PyPy    Haskell (unoptimized)   CPython<br>
0.348 s 2.054 s 2.334 s 25.996 s<br>
1 x 5.9 x   6.7 x   ~75 x<br>
These tests really show that PyPy is a huge improvement and it seems to be getting better by the day. After running these tests I was told that PyPy&#39;s main speedup is not in full force when calculating Fibonacci numbers as the outer loop probably never reaches JIT.</p>

<p>If you use Python and have not tried PyPy before - you really should. It makes a huge difference. PyPy is probably never going to be faster then compiled languages but it gets you closer!</p>

<p>Edit: There are several documented cases where PyPy is faster then compiled languages like C</p>

<p>Notes about testing<br>
GHCi, version 7.0.4 compiler for Haskell<br>
Python 2.7.1 interpreter<br>
PyPy 1.7.0<br>
Fibonacci was calculated for 36 recurrences<br>
For timing I used unix time command before every command issued.<br>
PyPy for Python<br>
PyPy is a project that Python really needs. It helps Python loose it&#39;s reputation of being just &quot;fast enough&quot; and becoming a litter more &quot;fast&quot;. And I think Python needs this now more then ever as there are signs of people not being fully happy with Python 3 current state, implementations and the process how we are transitioning there. There just aren&#39;t any real advantage over Python 2.</p>

<p>If Python 3 had PyPy support I think it would be easier to explain to ourselves why we need to port our code into Python 3. Armin Ronacher has already asked &quot;Can we accept PyPy as a valid Python implementation that is worth considering as having an effect on how we write code?&quot;. And I think we should.</p>

<p>I hope we do.</p>
